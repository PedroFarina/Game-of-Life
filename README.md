# Game of Life

This is a `Swift` project using `SceneKit` to build a version of [John Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Due to it's behavior, based on [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com) I decided to use the [Game Loop Pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html).
